# NAN_Chatbot
Hi, I'm trying to create a chatbot using python and socket.

Before you can use the python programs you have to install python.
Download here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

The port and the IP are from my chatbot server. You can download the files and change the host and the port in what you want.
